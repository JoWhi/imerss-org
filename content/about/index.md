## MISSION

To conduct multidisciplinary ecological research, monitor biodiversity and the environment, and communicate results to better understand and respond to change in the Salish Sea bioregion

## Who We Are

IMERSS is a federally incorporated Canadian non-profit society (1203734-3) and charity (735876336RR0001).
Our organization represents a multidisciplinary working group of scientists, scholars, artists and community
members committed to fostering an inclusive culture of research and conservation in a bioregion currently undergoing
rapid development and change. Engaging individuals and communities in ongoing research and monitoring, we support
immersive, place-based experiences that foster awareness and respect for the Salish Sea. We take a networked approach
to collecting, analyzing and sharing ecological data, helping to build community capacity for long-term ecological research at the local and regional scale.

## Where We Are Based

IMERSS is based on Galiano Island, in the southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, yet has a broad bioregional
focus. Our existing lab facilities support work in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, enabling a broad range of research.
